# financial-simulator-ios

Build a iOs app in Swift UI allowing user to simulate their financial transactions between 2 given dates provided by the user.

There should be a way for the user to add, modify and delete transactions and specify corresponding description, amount, initial date, and frequency of recurrence.

Possible recurrence should be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, annually. Recurring transaction should be programmed in the output

The output should be a table sorted by transaction date, showing the date, transaction description, amount and the cumulative balance of the bank account.

Note that the balance of the bank account at the initial date is an input provided by the user.

The data entered by users should be persisted in the core device storage
